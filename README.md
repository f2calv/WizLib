# WizLib
Philips Wiz Color &amp; Tunable White Light Bulb .NET API Library

This library is in active development.

Adapted from Python and Java source originally from (https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight) and also (https://github.com/SRGDamia1/openhab2-addons).

Many changes and improvements and funcionality added in addition to adaptation for C#.

**Note:** The **WizLib** library should compile and run on any .NET implementation that supports the System.Net.UdpClient object, but the example program **WizBulb** is built for Windows Desktop in .NET 5.0, and requires the libraries found in (https://github.com/nmoschkin/DataTools5) to run.
