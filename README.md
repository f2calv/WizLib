# WizLib
WiZ Color &amp; Tunable White Light Bulb .NET API Library

This library is in active development, and it's brand new so things will undoubtedly change while I consider next steps.

The library, itself, is pretty well documented, so far (the Bulb class is, anyway.)

Internal WiZ API workings gleaned from Python and Java source (https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight) and also (https://github.com/SRGDamia1/openhab2-addons).

**Note:** The **WizLib** library should compile with only NewtonSoft.Json, and run on any .NET implementation that supports the System.Net.UdpClient object, but the example program **WizBulb** is built for Windows Desktop in .NET 5.0, and requires the libraries found in (https://github.com/nmoschkin/DataTools5) to run.
